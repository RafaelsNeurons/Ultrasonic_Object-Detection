# Ultrasonic_Object-Detection
I created this project as part of my Master's degree. It is about object recognition using ultrasound data. The data set was provided by the university. It was ultrasound data recorded from five different objects. Google Colab was used.


Annotation:
The advantages of a Jupyter notebook could have been better used.
